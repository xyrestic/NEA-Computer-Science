how the camera works:
by default, i always draw the sprite image in the same position as sprite rectangle, but i can give sprite rectangle offset, which i will use for the camera, using Vector2.

for sprite in self.sprites():
	self.display_surface.blit(sprite.image,sprite.rect)

->

for sprite in self.sprites():
	self.display_surface.blit(sprite.image,sprite.rect+offset)

offset comes from player, then connect to sprite.rect vector. essentially i will give offset of the world to wherever the palyer is going to be
